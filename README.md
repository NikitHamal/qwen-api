## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To use `qwen-api`, you need to obtain your `AUTH TOKEN` and `COOKIE` from [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai). Follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up or Log In**  
   Visit [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai) and sign up or log in to your account.

2. **Open Developer Tools**

   - Right-click anywhere on the page and select `Inspect`, or
   - Use the shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Navigate to the `Network` tab

3. **Send a Message**  
   Go back to [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai) and send a message in the chat.

4. **Find the `completions` Request**  
   In the `Network` tab, filter by `Fetch/XHR` and locate a request named `completions`.

5. **Copy the Authorization Token and Cookie**

   - Click the `completions` request and go to the `Headers` tab.
   - Look for the `Authorization` header that starts with `Bearer`, and copy **only the token part** (without the word "Bearer").  
     Example:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     ```
   - Scroll down and find the `Cookie` header. Copy the entire value.  
     Example (partial):
     ```
     Cookie: cna=lyp6INOXADYCAbb9MozTsTcp; cnaui=83a0f88d-86d8-...; token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     ```

6. **Save in `.env` File**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and paste the following:

   ```env
   QWEN_AUTH_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  # no "Bearer"
   QWEN_COOKIE="cna=lyp6INOXADYCA...; cnaui=83a0f88d-86d8-...; token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:

- Never share your token or cookie publicly.
- Tokens and cookies may expire. If authentication fails, repeat the steps above to obtain a new one.
